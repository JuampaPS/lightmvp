# .cursorrules – Bunker Productions / lightmvp.vercel.app

You are helping maintain and expand the Bunker Productions website hosted at lightmvp.vercel.app.

## Project Overview
- Brand: BUNKER PRODUCTIONS – Creación & Diseño de experiencias inmersivas de luz y sonido.
- Purpose of the site:
  - Present a strong visual portfolio (NGBG, Werkstat, Mapping, etc.).
  - Explain clearly what Bunker does for non-technical clients.
  - Allow visitors to contact / book Bunker easily.
  - Support multiple languages: ES, SV, EN.
  - Later: grow into a “Community Hub”.

## Tech & Architecture (assumptions)
- React / Next.js project (keep existing structure).
- Tailwind CSS for styling (respect current classes).
- There is already an i18n structure for ES / SV / EN.
- DO NOT change router or i18n setup unless explicitly asked by the user.
- Prefer TypeScript where it already exists.

When generating or modifying code:
- Use React functional components and hooks.
- Keep components small, composable and typed.
- Use Tailwind utility classes instead of inline styles.
- Follow the existing file structure and naming conventions you see in the repo.

## Design Guidelines

Overall look:
- Dark, minimal, industrial/club atmosphere.
- Background: dark gray / near-black, as currently implemented.
- Accent colors: light/laser tones (cyan, magenta, electric blue) consistent with existing palette.
- Typography:
  - Use the current font stack.
  - Strong hierarchy: big, bold titles; clear section headings; shorter paragraphs.

Layout:
- Mobile-first and fully responsive.
- Use centered max-width containers (e.g. `max-w-5xl` / `max-w-6xl`, `mx-auto`, `px-4` / `px-6`).
- Keep enough vertical spacing (`py-12`–`py-20`) between sections.
- Cards should have soft rounded corners and subtle borders/shadows; avoid heavy glassmorphism.

Imagery:
- Keep the current project images and aspect ratios.
- When adding new sections that need visuals, use simple placeholders that fit the existing style.

## Navigation & Pages

The top navigation currently includes:
- Home
- Portafolio
- Comunidad / Hub
- Contacto

Respect these and keep their spelling and order unless the user asks to change them.

### 1. Home

Home already has:
- Hero with title, subtitle and intro text.
- A horizontal project slider/grid.

When editing:
- Do NOT remove the main hero copy unless asked.
- You may refine copy, but keep it short and punchy.
- You may add a primary CTA button (e.g. “Book a Demo” -> scroll to Contact) and a secondary CTA (“Ver Portafolio”).

If adding blocks to Home, they should be:
- A short “What we do” / “Servicios clave” strip.
- A “Formatos” section explaining horizontal vs vertical content.
- Keep new content under the hero and before the footer, and maintain the dark visual language.

### 2. Portafolio

The portfolio grid of projects (NGBG 25, Werkstat, Mapping, NGBG 24, History/Venues, Production CPH) is central to the site.

Rules:
- Keep the existing project cards and layout.
- When adding or editing projects:
  - Use a reusable data structure (array of objects) if not already present.
  - Each project should have: title, type (Festival / Club / Corporate / Immersive), short description, tags and images.
  - Maintain language variants for ES / SV / EN using the existing i18n pattern.

Do NOT introduce completely different layout patterns for some languages; visual structure should stay the same across ES/SV/EN.

### 3. Comunidad / Hub

There will be (or already is) a section for “Comunidad / Hub”.

When working on this area:
- Treat it as “Community Hub – Coming Soon” unless the user specifies full functionality.
- Content ideas:
  - Short explanation of the future hub (behind the scenes, convocatorias, tutoriales, playlists).
  - Optional email capture or a link to Contact.
- Keep this page lighter in content but visually consistent with the rest of the site.

### 4. Contacto

Contact section / page should:
- Explain briefly what info to send (type of event, fecha, tamaño del venue, referencias visuales).
- Provide:
  - A simple form (Nombre, Email, Mensaje).
  - Or at least a clear `mailto:` link to the contact email already visible in the site.

When editing:
- Ensure labels and placeholders are translated for ES / SV / EN.
- Preserve accessibility: use `<label>` elements linked to inputs.

## Internationalization (ES / SV / EN)

- Preserve the existing language switcher (ES, SV, EN) and how it works.
- Any new text should be added for all languages using the same pattern (translation files, dictionaries, or whatever structure the repo uses).
- Do NOT hard-code strings only in Spanish inside components that are already localized.

If you need to choose one language for code comments, use English.

## Code Style Rules

- Use semantic HTML tags: `<main>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`.
- Keep components focused: one responsibility per component.
- Extract reusable UI into `components/` (e.g. `Section`, `PageHeader`, `ProjectCard`, `LanguageSwitcher`), but reuse existing components where they already exist.
- When in doubt, follow the patterns you see in the current code base over inventing new ones.

## Don’ts

- Don’t change routing, folder structure or i18n config unless the user explicitly asks.
- Don’t add heavy JS animation libraries or new UI kits.
- Don’t drastically change the visual identity (colors, fonts, general dark style).
- Don’t remove the main portfolio content or navigation items.
- Don’t introduce inline styles or random global CSS without need.

Always prioritize:
1. Maintaining the current Bunker aesthetic.
2. Keeping the site simple and understandable for non-technical clients.
3. Clean, consistent, responsive code that fits the existing patterns.
